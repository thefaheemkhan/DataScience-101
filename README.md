Table 2.1: Binary operators
Operation	Description
a + b	Add a and b
a - b	Subtract b from a
a * b	Multiply a by b
a / b	Divide a by b
a // b	Floor-divide a by b, dropping any fractional remainder
a ** b	Raise a to the b power
a & b	True if both a and b are True; for integers, take the bitwise AND
a | b	True if either a or b is True; for integers, take the bitwise OR
a ^ b	For Booleans, True if a or b is True, but not both; for integers, take the bitwise EXCLUSIVE-OR
a == b	True if a equals b
a != b	True if a is not equal to b
a < b, a <= b	True if a is less than (less than or equal to) b
a > b, a >= b	True if a is greater than (greater than or equal to) b
a is b	True if a and b reference the same Python object
a is not b	True if a and b reference different Python objects
